Obsidian Reader Mode Highlighter

üìñ Overview

This Obsidian plugin enhances the Reader Mode experience by allowing users to highlight text, add comments, and manage annotations directly in preview mode. Unlike traditional markdown editing, this plugin enables seamless interaction with highlighted text, making it easier to review, modify, and organize notes without switching back to edit mode.

‚úÖ Comment on Highlights

	‚Ä¢	Uses smart text-matching logic to find highlights even if their formatting differs slightly from the raw markdown.

‚úÖ Fallback to Source Mode for Older Highlights
	‚Ä¢	If an older highlight cannot be modified in preview mode, the plugin automatically switches to source mode, updates the highlight, and switches back to preview mode seamlessly.

‚úÖ Minimalist & Modern Popup UI

	‚Ä¢	The comment editor is inline and intuitive, replacing the popup with a text box when adding comments.
